# Welcome to osgEarth

**osgEarth** is a C++ geospatial SDK and terrain engine.

osgEarth makes it easy to integrate a 3D map into your C++ application.
By creating an **earth file** -- a simple XML file that defines the contents of your map -- you can 
quickly and easy visualize terrian models, imagery, and GIS data directly from a wide variety of data
sources with as little coding as possible.

The "osg" stands for [OpenSceneGraph](https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph), the industry-leading open source 3D rendering SDK.

## Community Resources

Since osgEarth is a free open source SDK, the source code is
available to anyone and we welcome and encourage community participation
when it comes to testing, adding features, and fixing bugs.

**Public Forum**

The first way to interact with the osgEarth team and the user
community is through the [support forum](http://forum.osgearth.org). **Please read** and follow
these guidelines for using the forum. FOLLOWING THESE GUIDELINES will
make it MUCH MORE LIKELY that someone will respond and try to help:

  - Sign up for an account and use your real name. You can participate
    anonymously, but using your real name helps build a stronger
    community. Sign your posts too!
  - Limit yourself to *one topic* per post. Asking multiple questions
    in one post makes it too hard to keep track of responses.
  - Always include as much supporting information as possible. Post an
    *earth file* or *short code snippet*. Post the output to
    `osgearth_version --caps`. Post the output to `gdalinfo` if you
    are having trouble with a GeoTIFF or other data file. List
    everything you have tried so far.
  - Be patient!

**Professional Services**

The osgEarth team supports its efforts through professional services. At
[Pelican Mapping](http://pelicanmapping.com) we do custom software development and integration work
involving osgEarth (and geospatial technologies in general). We are based in the US but we work with clients all over the world.

## License
osgEarth is licensed under the [LGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).

This means that:

    1. You can link to the osgEarth SDK in any commercial or non-commercial
       application free of charge.

    2. If you make any changes to osgEarth *itself*, you must make those changes
       available as free open source software under the LGPL license. (Typically
       this means contributing your changes back to the project, but it is
       sufficient to host them in a public GitHub fork.)

    3. If you redistribute the osgEarth *source code* in any form, you must
       include the associated copyright notices and license information
       unaltered and intact.

    4. *iOS / static linking exception*: The LGPL requires that anything statically
       linked to an LGPL library (like osgEarth) also be released under the LGPL.
       We grant an exception to the LGPL in this case. If you statically link
       osgEarth with your proprietary code, you are *NOT* required to release your
       own code under the LGPL.

That's it. Enjoy!
